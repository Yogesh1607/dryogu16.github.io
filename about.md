Hello, my name is Yogesh David Ravi Kumar. An important thing about me is that I have a visual impairment. From a young age I have been interested in automobiles and as I got older I started learning more about new technologies like Self Driving Cars. The more I looked into what they do and how they work, the more I wanted to be a part of it. I have been working on learning more systematically about this as time goes on. The United States is a country that is heavily dependent on cars, forcing nearly everyone to use them. However, there is a large population that, for many different reasons, are unable to drive. I aim to be involved in bringing autonomous technology to the roads so that many people can have a new found freedom of movement, including me.
